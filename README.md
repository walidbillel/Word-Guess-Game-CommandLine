# Word-Guess-Game-CommandLine

## Game Logic 
* Once running node index.js the game will generate a random number that the user have to guess.
* The user has 7 chances to get the word right. 

## How it was created 
* A Letter constructor object was created first and imported as a module
* Then the Letter module was used to create A Word constructor that is then used in the main game
* The inquirer npm package was used to promot the user guesses.
